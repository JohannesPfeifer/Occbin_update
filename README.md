# Occbin

This is an unofficial repository maintaining an updated version of the OccBin-toolkit of 
Guerrieri/Iacoviello (2015): "OccBin: A Toolkit to Solve Models with Occasionally Binding 
Constraints Easily", Journal of Monetary Economics, 70, pp. 22-38.

It has been updated to maintain compatibility with Dynare versions more recent than the original
